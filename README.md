# arxiv-search
This project automates daily retrieval and semantic parsing of new arXiv papers, storing them in PostgreSQL via Supabase. It uses pgvector for embeddings, TimescaleDB for analytics, and Google Gemini API for semantic processing. The frontend is built with SvelteKit, providing a modern and responsive interface.
